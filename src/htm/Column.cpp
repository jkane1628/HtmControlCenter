	// CHANGED: Overlap is divided by Boost before being compared with _minOverlap, because _minOverlap doesn't have Boost factored into it. This makes them comparable.
	if ((Overlap / Boost) >= _minOverlap) // Note: Numenta docs indicate >, but given its function in boosting of trying to raise overlap to a number that allows activation (ie., minOverlap), >= makes more sense to me.
